## Definition
CRISPR is a useful tool for **genetic screening experiments**
CRISPR pooled libraries consist of thousands of plasmids, each containing multiple gRNAs for each target gene.

In a CRISPR screening experiment, target cells are treated with the pooled library to create **a population of mutant cells** that are then **screened for a phenotype of interest**.


steps for using pooled CRISPR libraries

1. CRISPR screening experiments require electroporation to amplify the pooled library and the use of Next-Generation Sequencing (NGS) to **confirm library representation**.
2. CRISPR screening experiments **require large quantities of cells** and therefore, may not be suitable for use when the number of cells is limited (e.g. primary cells).
3. Most CRISPR libraries require the use of lentivirus to deliver the gRNA/Cas9 to target cells. Therefore, you must be equipped and authorized to use lentivirus in your lab.
